# Mall Customers Clustering Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to segment customers into different groups based on their shopping habits at a mall. The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customers Dataset, which contains information about mall customers such as their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Dataset

The Mall Customers Dataset consists of the following features:

- `CustomerID`: Unique ID assigned to the customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

## Methodology

The project uses clustering algorithms to segment customers into different groups. The steps involved in the project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and preprocessed for the model.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to understand the data and find any interesting patterns.
3. **Model Building**: Clustering algorithms are applied to the data.
4. **Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated.
